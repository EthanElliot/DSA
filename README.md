# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repo contains implementations and solutions for a variety of data structures and algorithms, organized by programming language and problem type. This repository is utilized by [Ethan Elliot](https://github.com/EthanElliot), a Software Engineering student at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/), for learning, writing and testing data structures and algorithms.

The repository is organized as /{language}/{category}/{problem}, where {language} is the language that the solution is written in, {category} is the topic name and {problem} is the conforming name to the problem.
